Q1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language
 with object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity
 into otherwise static HTML pages. The general-purpose core of the
 language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and
 other web browsers.


Q2.How can you create an object in JavaScript?
JavaScript supports Object concept very well. You can create an
 object using the object literal as follows −

1 var emp = {
2 name: "Daniel",
3 age: 23
};


Q3. Define anonymous function.
In JavaScript, an anonymous function is a function that does not
 have a name. It is typically used for short, one-off tasks where
 naming the function is not essential.

Example:
1 function(parameters) {
2 // body of the function
3 } 


Q4.How can you create an Array in JavaScript?
You can define arrays using the array literal as follows-
1 var x = [];
2 var y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];



Q5. What is a name function in JavaScript & how to define it?
A named function declares a name as soon as it is defined. It can be
 defined using function keyword as :
function named(){
// write code here
}


Q6.What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?
The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is
 defined. JavaScript variable will have only two scopes.
• Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means 
it is visible everywhere in your JavaScript code.
• Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a 
function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.
